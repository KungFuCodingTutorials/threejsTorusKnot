# threejsTorusKnot
This is a simple project were i want to share how it's easy to add a 3D object on our project.

-- IMPORTANT --
If you want to try our project and do you want to run it locally (e.g. like navigate the file system with the browser), you will receive an error due to CORS policy.
To avoid that issue i reccomend to run this project with VS code live server extension.

Enjoy!
